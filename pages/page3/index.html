                <h1>Ningguang's Floating Jade Chamber</h1>
                <p>Ningguang is a professional businesswoman, having accumulated her wealth through hard work and perseverance. As the Tianquan, she is known for being highly meticulous in her work and holds a large amount of influence within Liyue.

                    She is a calculating and ruthless businesswoman guided by the sole aim of making Mora,"[2] which stems from her impoverished background.[3] She makes use of a large intelligence network and "pawns" to gain the information she needs, and will only make use of people whose weaknesses she knows.[4] As a result, she is disliked by those with significant influence, but nonetheless, many accept it as she adds to the overall prosperity of both the Qixing and Liyue Harbor itself.
                    
                    Despite her cold, business-driven exterior, she has Liyue's best interests at heart. Under her decree in response to a case of water contamination, those who intentionally endanger public health and safety should be "shown no mercy whatsoever."[5] When Osial was reawakened and threatened Liyue Harbor, she put her conflict with the adepti aside and ultimately sacrificed the Jade Chamber, her life's work, to seal it away. Though per usual, she quickly had it rebuilt for her ambitions to have it spread all across the nations of Teyvat. She is also particularly fond of children, both because they give her vital intelligence and she enjoys seeing them smile.</p>
