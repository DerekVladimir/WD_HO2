                <h2>SPIRITED AWAY</h2>
                <p>Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home. Chihiro's father decides to take a shortcut and stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, which her mother insists on exploring despite Chihiro's protests. Upon finding a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked with food, Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro reaches an enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers her parents have turned into pigs, and she is unable to cross the now-flooded river.</p>
