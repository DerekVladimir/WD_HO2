                <h2>Fontaine</h2>
                <p>Fontaine is a region in Genshin Impact where Act IV of the main story takes place1. It is presided over by the yet unnamed Hydro Archon and values justice above all else1. The region also seems to prize technology and the arts, and has a newspaper publication read all across Teyvat known as “The Steambird”1. To unlock Fontaine's main story, you need to reach 40 adventure ranks and complete chapter 6 of the 3th volume of the Archons' quests "Caribert"2.</p>
